# Calculator App

## About the project
In this project I built a calculator using only kotlin.

Instead of using findViewById on all buttons.
I preferred to create a function in the mainActivity called onDigit, and assign it to each button through the android:onClick property

I know that it is no longer the practice recommended by android studio, however, it made development easier.
In real applications I follow best practices.
